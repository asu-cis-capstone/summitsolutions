	I propose to help collect data for market saturation for better marketing purposes.  If you know what markets and areas
were bringing in business you would know where to spend more money for advertising and where not to.  Having a website is 
a great tool of the trade, but really getting out there and advertising would help create more revenue and cut losses.  With 
this data, you can have multiple test markets to keep expanding your business, while saving money.  We will use this database
to collect all of your clients information to see how what areas you have the most business in.  With that information you 
can do more advertising in market areas with magazine inserts, local news papers, mailing adds, and flyers.  These are just 
some of the advertising techniques you would be able to put into action using this information.

	To implement this we would use SQL Server as the main database and use Microsoft Access for forms, reports, and queries.  
We would need to do a re-design of the web-site so it can accept information and passed it to a PHP script.  We need a PHP 
script so we pass all of the data to SQL Server that will be holding all of the information used for analysis.  It would take 
anywhere from a month to six months to get the database completely up and functioning to full capacity.  I would suggest at
least at a minimum of two Data Miners and an expert in marketing techniques.  Other resources needed will be physical materials
for advertising (Digital Cameras, printing equipment, etc.), software, and hardware.
