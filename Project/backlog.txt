Hi everyone,

It was wonderful to meet you both today! We are excited to start building your site! Here are the notes a I took from today’s first meeting. (Steve, lets PUSH this document to the GIT Hub :) ).  Please let me know if anything looks incorrect or needs to be changed. Rebecca, we have a list of items we’re looking for from you! The logo and approval for $1 a month is the most important at this point, once you go ahead with those two items we can get a site up and ready to preview tomorrow! 

Thank you all so much for your time, and thank you so much for lunch it was great!

What we need from Rebecca 
- Wordpress is free to install
o 1$ a month pays for Go Daddy to keep your word press site updated, backs up your website nightly, Extra security – firewall and malware scanning, Free themes .. most importantly support 24/7 from godaddy  (cheaper than hiring someone to do wordpress updates) 
o Need your approval on this update before I install wordpress 
o Other option is to hire a support person to keep the software updated 
- Go through images to let us know which ones / where they go
- Send Logo ASAP 
- Content “Blurb” for home page sections  
o These are the categories I took from this site (http://www.summitengineeringinc.com/) 
o If you want to add/remove any categories for the home page please let us know! 
o Restorations
o Forensic Investigations
o Design Of Special Structures 
o Structural Building Design
o Construction Services 
- Personal “About page” Background Content 
- Good news: Google Analytics standard account is free ! (This is another marketing tool)  Unless your site is over 250,000 clicks a day you won’t need to pay for this service.
